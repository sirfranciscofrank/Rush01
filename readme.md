# Rush01 — Skyscraper Puzzle Solver

## The puzzle

You have a 4x4 grid. Every cell gets a "box" (skyscraper) of height 1, 2, 3
or 4.

Two rules:

1. **Latin square rule** — each row and each column contains every height
   exactly once (like Sudoku: no duplicates in a row or column).
2. **Visibility rule** — the 16 numbers given on the command line are
   *clues*. Each clue says how many boxes you can see when looking along a
   row or a column from outside the grid. A taller box hides every shorter
   box behind it.

Example for one line `1 2 3 4`:

- From the **left** you see 4 boxes (each one is taller than the previous).
- From the **right** you see only 1 (the 4 hides everything).

For the line `2 1 4 3`: from the left you see the 2, the 1 is hidden, the 4
is visible, the 3 is hidden → **2 visible**.

## Input format

```
./rush01 "c1t c2t c3t c4t  c1b c2b c3b c4b  r1l r2l r3l r4l  r1r r2r r3r r4r"
```

The 16 clues arrive in this order (we store them in `clues[0]`..`clues[15]`):

| Index in `clues[]` | Meaning                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0–3                | columns 1–4 seen from the **top**    |
| 4–7                | columns 1–4 seen from the **bottom** |
| 8–11               | rows 1–4 seen from the **left**      |
| 12–15              | rows 1–4 seen from the **right**     |

Anything that is not exactly 16 digits (`1`–`4`) separated by single spaces
is an error → print `Error`.

## How the program flows

Every function is annotated with the file it lives in, so you can follow
any call straight to its source:

```
main (main.c)
 ├─ ft_init_grid        (main.c)      fill grid with 0 (0 = empty cell)
 ├─ ft_parse            (ft_parse.c)  validate the string, extract 16 clues
 ├─ ft_solve            (ft_solve.c)  backtracking: try to fill the grid
 │   ├─ ft_is_safe        (ft_rules.c)  value not already in row/column?
 │   └─ ft_check_partial  (ft_solve.c)  row or column just completed?
 │       ├─ ft_check_row    (ft_rules.c) → ft_count_left / ft_count_right
 │       └─ ft_check_col    (ft_rules.c) → ft_count_top / ft_count_bottom
 │                                          (all four in ft_views.c)
 └─ ft_print_grid       (ft_print.c)  print the solution
                                      (or "Error" if parse/solve failed)
```

The grid is a 2D array `int grid[4][4]`, so cell (row, col) is simply
`grid[row][col]` — easy to read, easy to trace. The solver visits the cells
with a single counter `pos` that runs from 0 to 15 (left-to-right,
top-to-bottom): `pos / 4` is the row, `pos % 4` is the column.

## File by file

Six source files, one job each. Every file except `main.c` carries the
classic 42 `ft_` prefix, matching the function names inside it — see a call
to `ft_check_row` anywhere and you know it lives in `ft_rules.c`.

### main.c

- `ft_init_grid` — sets all 16 cells to `0`, meaning "empty".
- `main` — checks there is exactly **one** argument (`argc != 2` → Error),
  parses it, launches the solver from position 0, prints the result.
  Returns `1` on error, `0` on success.

### ft_parse.c

- `ft_strlen` — string length (we can't use the libc one; only `write`,
  `malloc`, `free` are allowed).
- `ft_is_valid_format` — a valid input is **exactly 31 characters**:
  16 digits + 15 spaces. Even positions (0, 2, 4, …) must be a digit
  `'1'`–`'4'`, odd positions must be a single space. Anything else →
  invalid. This strictness is deliberate: a double space, a leading space
  or a trailing space is a badly formatted input and must print `Error`.
- `ft_parse` — once the format is validated, converts each digit character
  to an int (`str[i * 2] - '0'`) and stores it in `clues[]`.

### ft_solve.c — the heart of the program (backtracking)

- `ft_solve(grid, pos, clues)` — tries to fill cell `pos`, then recursively
  the next one:

  1. If `pos == 16`, every cell is filled and every check passed →
     **solved**, return 1.
  2. Otherwise try each value 1, 2, 3, 4 in that cell:
     - Skip it if it already appears in this row or column (`ft_is_safe`).
     - Place it, and if the clue checks still hold (`ft_check_partial`),
       recurse on `pos + 1`.
     - If the recursion succeeds, propagate the 1 all the way up.
     - If it fails, **undo** the cell (`grid[row][col] = 0`) and try the
       next value. This "undo and try something else" is the
       *backtracking*.
  3. If no value works, return 0 so the previous cell tries its next value.

  Because values are always tried in order 1→4 and cells in order 0→15, the
  first solution found is always the same one — that's the "first solution
  you encounter" the subject asks for.

- `ft_check_partial(grid, row, col, clues)` — we don't wait until the grid
  is full to check clues. As soon as a **row is complete** (we just filled
  its last cell, `col == 3`) we verify that row's two clues; as soon as a
  **column is complete** (`row == 3`) we verify that column's two clues. If
  a check fails we abandon this branch immediately instead of filling the
  rest of the grid for nothing. This pruning is what makes the solver fast.

### ft_rules.c — the checks

- `ft_check_row(grid, row, clues)` — compares what you actually see from
  the left with `clues[8 + row]`, and from the right with
  `clues[12 + row]`.
- `ft_check_col(grid, col, clues)` — same for a column: from the top vs
  `clues[col]`, from the bottom vs `clues[4 + col]`.
- `ft_is_safe(grid, row, col, value)` — scans the row and the column in a
  single loop; returns 0 if `value` is already there (Latin square rule).

### ft_views.c — the visibility algorithm

Four small functions, one per viewing direction, so each one reads exactly
like the way you'd trace it by hand:

- `ft_count_left(grid, row)` — walk the row left→right.
- `ft_count_right(grid, row)` — walk the row right→left.
- `ft_count_top(grid, col)` — walk the column top→bottom.
- `ft_count_bottom(grid, col)` — walk the column bottom→top.

All four use the same idea: keep track of the tallest box seen so far
(`max`); every box taller than `max` is visible — count it and update
`max`. No copying rows into temp arrays, no reversing: just walk the grid
in the direction you are looking.

```
line = 2 1 4 3   (looking from the left)
2 > 0 → visible (count=1, max=2)
1 < 2 → hidden
4 > 2 → visible (count=2, max=4)
3 < 4 → hidden
→ 2 visible boxes
```

### ft_print.c — output

- `ft_putchar` / `ft_putstr` — wrappers around `write` (the only allowed
  output function).
- `ft_print_error` — writes `Error\n`.
- `ft_print_grid` — prints the 16 cells as 4 lines of 4 digits separated by
  spaces (no trailing space, newline at the end of each row).

## Walkthrough of one solve step

Clues: `"4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2"`.

Column 1 seen from the top must show **4** boxes → the column has to be
`1 2 3 4` (strictly increasing is the only way to see all 4). The solver
doesn't "know" this as a rule, but backtracking discovers it: any other
arrangement fails `ft_check_col` and gets undone.

Cell by cell it tries 1 in `grid[0][0]` → safe → not end of row/col → move
on; 1 in `grid[0][1]` → duplicate in row → try 2 → safe → … Each dead end
rolls back to the last choice point. The final grid:

```
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 1
3 4 1 2
4 1 2 3
```

## Compile & run

```
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o rush01 *.c
./rush01 "4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2"
```

Errors (wrong argument count, bad format, impossible clues) print `Error`
followed by a newline. See `compililation.md` for the full test battery.

## Questions an evaluator might ask

- **Why `pos / 4` and `pos % 4`?** The solver visits cells with a single
  counter `pos` (0 to 15); division gives the row, modulo gives the column
  of the 2D grid.
- **What is backtracking?** Depth-first trial and error: place a value, go
  deeper; on failure, erase it and try the next value. Guaranteed to find a
  solution if one exists, because it explores every consistent possibility.
- **Why check clues before the grid is full?** Pruning. A completed
  row/column that already violates its clues can never lead to a solution,
  so we cut the branch early.
- **Why is the first solution deterministic?** Cells are filled in a fixed
  order and values tried in a fixed order (1→4), so the search always
  visits candidate grids in the same sequence.
- **Why four counting functions instead of one?** Each direction gets its
  own ten-line function (`ft_count_left`, `ft_count_right`, `ft_count_top`,
  `ft_count_bottom`) that walks the grid exactly the way your eye would.
  One clever parameterized function would be shorter, but four obvious ones
  are easier to trace and defend in an evaluation.
- **Why no malloc?** Everything fits in fixed-size stack arrays
  (`int grid[4][4]`, `int clues[16]`), so dynamic allocation is
  unnecessary.
